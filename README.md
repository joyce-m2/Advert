# Advert
For my first FSWD(Full Stack Web Development) Project, I created an ad page for a sunscreen ðŸ”†ðŸ§´ product, which had 4 htmls linked to each other.


This was my first ever ad page, which included, html, css, and javascript with form validation.


I even used an online AI tool to convert from text to speech, in order to use it as audio reviews of the sunscreen product from our costumers.

In order to see the page for yourself, just download the codes and the media files such as the videos, audios and the images. Just upload the code on your preferred IDE, and you can run it for yourself.
